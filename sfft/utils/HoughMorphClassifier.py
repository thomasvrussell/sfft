        # MeLOn Notes
        # @ Point-Source Extractor
        #   A) A PSFEx suggested Morphological Classifier, based on a 2D distribution diagram
        #      FLUX_RADIUS [X-axis] - MAG_AUTO [Y-axis], A universal but naive approach.
        #      We first draw all isolated sources on the plane, and the typical distribution will form a 'Y' shape.
        #      A nearly vertical branch, A nearly horizontal branch and their cross with a tail at faint side.
        #
        #      Here I give rough conclusions with comments, note I have compared with Legacy Survety Tractor Catalog.
        #      a. The point sources would be distributed around the nearly vertical stright line. {vertical branch}
        #         NOTE At the faint end, point sources no longer cling to the line, being diffuse in the cross and tail.
        #      b. Close to the bright end of the stright-line are saturated or slight-nonlinear sources, with a deviated direction.
        #      c. The right side of the line are typically extended structure, mainly including various galaxies. {horizontal branch}
        #         NOTE At the faint end, likewise, extended sources also exist, being diffuse in the cross and tail.
        #      d. Scattering points are located at very left side of the line, they are generally hotpix, cosmic-ray or 
        #         some small-scale artifacts. Keep in mind, they are typically outlier-like and away from the cross and tail.
        #
        #      METHOD: For simplicity, we only crudely divide the diagram into 3 regions, w.r.t. the vertical line.
        #              they are, Radius-Mid (FR-M), Radius-Large (FR-L) and Radius-Small (FR-S).
        #
        #   B) 3 hierarchic groups                
        #      > "Good" Sources:
        #        + NOT in FR-S region (union of FR-M & FR-L)
        #          NOTE Good Sources is consist of the vertical & horizontal branches with their cross (not the tail), 
        #               which is roughly equivalent to the set of REAL Point-Sources & Extended Sources 
        #               with rejection the samples in the tail (at faint & small-radius end).
        #          NOTE Good Sources are commonly used as FITTING Candidates in Image Subtraction.
        #               It is acceptable to lose the samples in the tail.
        #         
        #        >> {subgroup} "Point-like" Sources:
        #               + Restricted into FR-M Region   |||   Should be located around the Hough-Line
        #               + Basically Circular-Shape      |||   PSFEx-ELLIPTICITY = (A-B) / (A+B) < PointSource_MINELLIP
        #
        #                 NOTE At cross region, this identification criteria mis-include some extended source
        #                      On the flip side, some REAL PointSource samples are missing in the tail.
        #                 NOTE Point Sources are usually employed as FWHM Estimator.
        #                 NOTE We may lossen PointSource_MINELLIP if psf itself is significantly asymmetric (e.g. tracking problem).
        #
        #                 WARNING: At the faint end, this subgroup would be contaminated by round extended sources 
        #                          (meet PointSource_MINELLIP) which also lie in the cross region. Especially when the field 
        #                          is galaxy-dominated, the contamination can be considerable. In light of the fact that 
        #                          cross region is located at the faint end in the belt, we calculate the median FWHM 
        #                          weighted by source flux, to suppress the over-estimate trend driven by the extended sources.
        #
        #   C) Additional WARNINGS
        #      a. This extracor is ONLY designed for sparse field (isolated sources dominated cases).
        #         We generally only take these isloated & non-saturated sources (FLAGS = 0) into account.
        #         But one may also loosen the constrain on FLAGS to be [0,2].
        #
        #      b. We employ Hough Transform to detect the Stright-Line feature in the image, 
        #         naturally sampled from the raw scatter diagram. But note such diagram makes sense 
        #         only if we could detect enough sources (typically > 200) in the given image.
        #         NOTE Reversed axes employed --- MAG_AUTO [X-axis] - FLUX_RADIUS [Y-axis].

        # * calssifier based on hough detection  
        #   We use hough transform to detect the point source belt from the scatter points 
        #   (X: MAG_AUTO, Y: FLUX_RADIUS). The belt is a nearly horizontal straight line.
        #
        #   NOTE: the point source belt has a typical theta of 1.5d +/- 1.0d. on this occasion, 
        #         we should stick with the classic implementation of hough transform in 
        #         scikit-image [0.16.1 to 0.18.3], where the measurement bias on rho
        #         is closer to zero than the new implementation!
        #
        #   NOTE: in general, the point source belt is the strongest line feature. 
        #         by default, -Hough_PeakClip=0.7 is proper in most cases.
        #         however, for galaxy dominated fields (e.g., JWST imagines of galaxy cluster),
        #         the point-source-belt can be not very pronounced, and one may should reduce 
        #         the parameter from default 0.7 to, says, ~ 0.4.
        #
        #   Remarks on the Mask
        #   It can be essential to apply restrictions on FLUX_RADIUS (R) for the scatter points used in hough transform. 
        #   (1) Exclude the sources with unusally large R (e.g., R > 20.0) can speed up the calculations.
        #       One can control the upper limit of R using parameter -Hough_MAXFR
        #
        #   (2) The sources with very small R (e.g., R < 0.5) may become districtions for hough detection.
        #       They are not point sources, likely hot pixels or cosmic rays, sometimes,
        #       wrong line features will be detected by chance without proper rejections.
        #
        #       NOTE: One can control the lower limit of R via parameter -Hough_MINFR,
        #             the recommended values of Hough_MINFR range from 0.1 to 1.0. One should choose 
        #             a proper value according to the instrument configuration and typical seeing conditions.
