    Parameters
    ----------
    label_image : (M, N[, P]) ndarray
        Labeled input image. Labels with value 0 are ignored.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.14.1
            Previously, ``label_image`` was processed by ``numpy.squeeze`` and
            so any number of singleton dimensions was allowed. This resulted in
            inconsistent handling of images with singleton dimensions. To
            recover the old behaviour, use
            ``regionprops(np.squeeze(label_image), ...)``.
    intensity_image : (M, N[, P][, C]) ndarray, optional
        Intensity (i.e., input) image with same size as labeled image, plus
        optionally an extra dimension for multichannel data.
        Default is None.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18.0
            The ability to provide an extra dimension for channels was added.
    cache : bool, optional
        Determine whether to cache calculated properties. The computation is
        much faster for cached properties, whereas the memory consumption
        increases.
    coordinates : DEPRECATED
        This argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version
        of scikit-image.

        See :ref:`Coordinate conventions <numpy-images-coordinate-conventions>`
        for more details.

        .. deprecated:: 0.16.0
            Use "rc" coordinates everywhere. It may be sufficient to call
            ``numpy.transpose`` on your label image to get the same values as
            0.15 and earlier. However, for some properties, the transformation
            will be less trivial. For example, the new orientation is
            :math:`\frac{\pi}{2}` plus the old orientation.
    extra_properties : Iterable of callables
        Add extra property computation functions that are not included with
        skimage. The name of the property is derived from the function name,
        the dtype is inferred by calling the function on a small sample.
        If the name of an extra property clashes with the name of an existing
        property the extra property wil not be visible and a UserWarning is
        issued. A property computation function must take a region mask as its
        first argument. If the property requires an intensity image, it must
        accept the intensity image as the second argument.
